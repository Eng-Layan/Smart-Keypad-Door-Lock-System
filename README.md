# Smart Keypad Door Lock System

This is my third embedded systems project using Arduino and real hardware components, as part of my personal learning and portfolio development.

## Project Overview

A smart door lock system that allows the user to input a 4-digit password via keypad.  
If correct: the servo unlocks the door and LCD shows a success message.  
If incorrect: after 3 failed attempts, a buzzer alarm is triggered and the system locks.  
A reset button restores the system to its initial state.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno  
- 4x4 Keypad  
- LCD 1602 (non-I2C)  
- Servo Motor  
- Buzzer  
- Push Button (Reset)  
- Potentiometer (for LCD contrast)  
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

## Skills Practiced

- Arduino Programming (C++)  
- Embedded Systems Design  
- LCD and Keypad Interfacing  
- Servo Motor Control  
- Basic Hardware Debugging  
- Security Logic Implementation  
- Breadboard Wiring and Testing

## Project Videos

Video 1: Correct Password Entry  
[Watch: Correct Password Demo](https://youtu.be/SjerBMjpxxc)  
The user enters the correct password and the servo unlocks the door.

Video 2: Incorrect Password Entry  
[Watch: Incorrect Password Demo](https://youtu.be/OfVIvtr_v-E)  
The user enters wrong passwords three times, triggering the buzzer and locking the system.

## Future Improvements

- Save password to EEPROM  
- Add fingerprint or RFID authentication  
- Include real-time clock module (RTC)  
- Send SMS alerts via GSM on failed login attempts
